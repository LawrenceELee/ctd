# ctd
ctd sample code

This is a sample project for CTD.

It is a simple webpage that makes a API request to https://swapi.dev/api/people/1 and displays the returned JSON object to a textarea for programming/debugging purposes.
It uses a for-loop to look for the movies that Luke Skywalker is in and creates hyperlinks out of them.
